This is a master repository for a collection of small to medium-sized React Native applications. Each app was (or will be) built for one of Steven Grider's courses. Specifically, his ["The Complete React Native + Hooks Course [2020 Edition]"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/). 

The goal here is to simply stay on top of the latest React Native features and best practices, even if I am already familiar with many of the topics covered. Among other things, the various apps in this repo delve into:   

* FlatList  
* Navigation with React Navigation 5
* Reusable components
* Images
* State Management at the Component Level
* Redux, Actions, Reducers
* "Gotchas" regarding State 
* _Not_ mutating state 
* Layout, Flex, Absolute Fill Objects, Box Object Model 
* Incorporating "outside" or 3rd-party APIs
* Hooks, reusable and otherwise
* Constraining views 
* "WithNavigation" helper
* Context, Advanced State Management
* Moving data with Context 
* Data API Sync
* Building a custom Express API with MongoDB 
* Understanding the signup flow/process
* Defining User Schema
* JSON Web Tokens, creating a JWT, wiring up JWTs
* Password hashing, salting and hashing
* Auth Context
* React Native Maps 
* UseCallback hook
* Coordination between Contexts
* _Rendering lists the right way_
* Authentication with Firebase
* Processing authentication credentials
* And more ...
