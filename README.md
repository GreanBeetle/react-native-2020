This is a master repository for a collection of small to medium-sized React Native applications. Each app was (or will be) built for one of Steven Grider's courses. Specifically, his ["The Complete React Native + Hooks Course [2020 Edition]"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/). 

[The official repository for the entire course is here.](https://github.com/StephenGrider/rn-casts)

The goal here is to simply stay on top of the latest React Native features and best practices, even though much of this is recap. Among other things, the various apps in this repo delve into:   
 
* React Navigation 5
* Redux, Actions, Reducers
* "Gotchas" regarding State 
* _Not_ mutating state 
* Layout, Flex, Absolute Fill Objects, Box Object Model 
* 3rd-party APIs
* Hooks, reusable and otherwise
* Constraining views 
* "WithNavigation" helper
* Context, Advanced State Management
* Moving data with Context 
* Data API Sync
* Building a custom Express API with MongoDB 
* Understanding the signup flow/process
* Defining User Schema
* JSON Web Tokens, creating a JWT, wiring up JWTs
* Password hashing, salting and hashing
* Auth Context
* React Native Maps 
* UseCallback hook
* Coordination between Contexts
* _Rendering lists the right way_
* Authentication with Firebase
* Processing authentication credentials
* And more ...
